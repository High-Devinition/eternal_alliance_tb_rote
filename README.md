# Interactive ROTE TB Map
## About
This tool is designed for helping guilds achieve their maximum potential
in the rise of the empire territory battle in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.

The tool is created from, reworked from, and improves upon the original interactive map for Rise of the Empire TB
hosted and available to use at ```https://genskaar.github.io/tb_empire/```; created by Genskaar. This was originally adopted from a 
design by GitHub user jetkokos, who left the community a while ago but we retain the license set out in that repository.
```https://github.com/jetkokos/tb_geo/blob/master/LICENSE```


To view the newest and reworked version of the map, simply open the index.html file in your favorite
web browser. You can also save the index.html link as a shortcut on your desktop/device home screen! Alternatively, you can visit:
